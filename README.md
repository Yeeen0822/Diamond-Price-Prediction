# Diamond Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 1. Overview

This project aims to predict the price of diamonds using machine learning regression models. By leveraging various diamond attributes, we build predictive models that can estimate diamond prices with high accuracy.

Key Challenges Addressed

✅ Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

✅ Feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.

✅ Comparing multiple regression models for performance evaluation.

✅ Deploying a user-friendly prediction system for stakeholders.

## 2. Business Understanding 

2.1 Problem Background

Shiny Diamond Company, a leading player in the diamond industry since 1978, specializes in sourcing, manufacturing, and distributing high-quality diamonds. They aim to leverage machine learning algorithms to predict diamond prices accurately, ensuring competitive pricing and customer satisfaction.

By analyzing diamond characteristics such as carat weight, cut, clarity, color, and depth, we aim to build a predictive pricing model that enhances decision-making in diamond valuation.

2.2 Aim

The aim of this project is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately estimates diamond prices based on their attributes.

2.3 Objectives

1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing:

Gather a comprehensive dataset containing relevant diamond features.

Clean and preprocess data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.

Perform feature selection and scaling for improved model performance.

2️⃣ Model Development & Evaluation:

Implement and compare four regression models:

✔ Decision Tree Regression

✔ Random Forest Regression

✔ Gradient Boosting Regression

✔ K-Neighbors Regression

Evaluate models using R² score, Adjusted R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE.


In collaboration with https://github.com/HackerDoggo101

## 3️⃣ Deployment:

Integrate the best-performing model into a user-friendly application.

Allow stakeholders to input diamond attributes and get real-time price predictions.
